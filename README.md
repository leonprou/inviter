# Wedding invitation

This is a little flask app for inviting people to private events via email. I made this as a personal project so the most of the stuff not customizable and ad hoc configured for me (and the texts are in hebrew). Feel free to use and feedback.


## Getting Started

You should add a file `secret.py` at the root with `EMAIL_PASSWORD` and `SECRET_KEY`
